                <p>Hello, my name is Zachary Callahan. I'm 20 years old and I'm from the US. I have been studying and
                    working with computers since 2016. I also am pursuing a career in Software engineering at Kent State
                    University I got into coding around 2018. I got into coding because I always wanted to create a
                    Minecraft server and the only way to make a good one was by learning how to code plugins. Of course,
                    as most developers, no coding isn't the easiest thing to get into. The entire path has ups and downs
                    and you lose motivation very quickly. I was on and off of coding for about 2-3 years. I finally
                    decided to just stick with it and well, of course now give up. Well now look. I have come far enough
                    to create this website. Was it worth it? I think it definitely was. I'm currently working on
                    bettering my knowledge in the programming field by learning as many languages as I can. While
                    staying proficient in each one.</p>
