                <p>PrisonEvolved was my first big project. We created this over six years with my best friend. We
                    went<br>
                    through many versions of this server. It took thousands of hours of research and development. I
                    was<br>
                    the entire backend portion of this "Network"; Along with a portion of the frontend side of
                    things.<br>
                    Throughout this project, we made around $3000 of net profit. <br>
                    <br>
                    Although this project gave us many ups and downs but expanded his and my knowledge by a great
                    <br>
                    extent. This was the main reason I got into coding. Without coding, a Minecraft server is almost
                    <br>
                    impossible to make, but over 90% of it was done without it. This was because of our great
                    problem <br>
                    solving. We were able to make our wildest dreams come true. We did this my extensive research of
                    <br>
                    figuring out how we could incorporate one plugin's function into another. Although this did have
                    a major <br>
                    drawback. It made the performance of the server go way done, which gave us a limit of how much
                    we <br>
                    could add. We eventually realized this, and we decided to shut down the server. The reason for
                    this <br>
                    It was because it was too big of a project for two people. Having one person code the entire
                    server<br>
                    and the other one was coming up with ideas and handing players. It just became too much. <br>
                    <br>
                    This, by far, was my favorite project that I have worked on. It gave us many challenges, which
                    led <br>
                    us to learn some valuable lessons. It also was the main reason that got me to start my career
                    as<br>
                    a Software Engineer!

                <p>LearnSpigot is the reason why I am where I am. What is LearnSpigot? LearnSpigot is one of the
                    largest <br>
                    course that teaches you the Spigot API for Minecraft Development. Which is soon to have over
                    10,000 <br>
                    student. With a discord server of over 5,000 students. I have very happy to say that I was able
                    to claim <br>
                    support role within the discord server. Which is filled with great and knowledgeable people. Our
                    role <br>
                    as a support team is to engage with peers in order to help others with development issues that
                    they <br>
                    are facing. This allows us all to expand our knowledge miraculously and give us experience in
                    new <br>
                    places. That we may not have been able to. It allows me to build the skills that are required in
                    a <br>
                    team setting. I am very excited to be a part of this amazing community that Stephen (the owner)
                    <br>
                    has built, and I hope I will always be a part of it!

                <p>The ZombieArena project is probably the project that I am most proud of. The amount of hour and
                    effort <br>
                    was put into this is insane (still currently a work in progress). With 9000 lines of code
                    written in over <br>
                    60 classes. This project is my first ever within the genre of programming. Although the code may
                    not be <br>
                    the cleanest. It has allowed me to fully understand how to develope something from scratch.
                    Throughout <br>
                    the creation of this. I was challenged with a lot bugs and problems. Although the community of
                    <br>
                    LearnSpigot were able to give me the resources and knowledge needed to go in the right
                    direction. <br>
                    <br>
                    Part of me wants to fully re-code the entire project due to the amount that I learned throughout
                    the <br>
                    process. I know I could make the project work a lot better a long with making the code
                    productivity <br>
                    much better. Maybe some day I will! If you'd like to see the source code of this project. <br>
