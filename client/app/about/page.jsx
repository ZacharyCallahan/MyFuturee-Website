                <p className="text-white text-lg sm:text-2xl  text-center">
                    My name is Zachary Callahan. As a student at Kent State
                    University, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering,
                    and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities this
                    field holds for me.
                    Since I was young, I have been passionate about technology
                    and its ability to transform the way we live, work, and
                    communicate. This passion led me to explore the world of web
                    development, where I discovered my love for Full Stack
                    development. Through hard work, dedication, and a commitment
                    to excellence, I have honed my skills and become a
                    proficient Full Stack web developer.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As someone who is fortunate enough to turn my hobby into a
                    career, I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunities I
                    have had to work on exciting projects and collaborate with
                    talented individuals. I approach every project with
                    enthusiasm and a desire to deliver high-quality work that
                    exceeds expectations.
                    My work ethic is one of my greatest strengths. I am
                    committed to putting in the time and effort necessary to
                    produce exceptional results, whether I am working on a team
                    or independently. I am a problem solver at heart, and I
                    enjoy taking on new challenges and finding creative
                    solutions to complex issues.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong
                    communicator and collaborator. I believe that effective
                    communication is essential for successful project outcomes,
                    and I am always willing to lend a hand and work with others
                    to achieve our shared goals.
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I hope
                    that my passion, work ethic, and dedication to excellence
                    have come through in my words. I am excited about the future
                    and the opportunities that lie ahead, and I look forward to
                    continuing to grow and learn as a Full Stack web developer.
